It survives between crops in rice stubble, straw and weed hosts, especially Leersia (cutgrass), and enters the plant through leaf pores (hydathodes), wounds and cracks at the base of leaf sheaths. It spreads through splashing and wind-blown rain, irrigation and flood water, and leaf contact. Severity increases with flooding and heavy nitrogen fertilization, especially on susceptible varieties.',
                'symptoms' => 'Kresek (seedling phase): leaves wilt, roll up and turn grayish green, usually 1-3 weeks after transplanting, and the plant may die. Squeezing the base of an infected seedling releases yellowish bacterial ooze, and unlike stem borer damage, the plant does not pull out of the soil easily. Leaf blight (older plants): water-soaked to yellow-orange stripes start at leaf tips or edges and grow with wavy margins. Milky ooze droplets may appear on young lesions early in the morning. Lesions turn yellow to white, then grayish, and the leaf dries out.',
